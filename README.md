# map-problem

maps vs objects fun (or not)

- Implement your changes in run.js and map.js
- Test with `node test.js`

`node utils/testMap.js` and `node utils/testObject.js` to see some basic performance analysis
or open with any browser index.map.html and index.object.html and look at the console logs

TODO: Add a test to compare performances of getting the size of an map vs that of an object
